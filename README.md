-Today I wanted to give myself time to build with tailwind after struggling for days to install it with an npm I decided to use the cdn method as I have before thinking that using npm is the only way for projects of these days,its hard self learning but it hits home to figure things out even before people reply back to you when you asked for assistance

\*Challenges
-I am learning the basic structure or rther the traditional structure of a webpage put nav bars on top image backgroud sometimes have me guising if I'm right the vscode preview extention is helpful
-Finding the right designs on tailwind can be challenging AI helped with the animations tthat were not visible
-Learning what py-3 and what px-2 was fun
-Focusing on one element when my mind is blank is time consuming
-learning the importance of a responsive page for both desktop and mobile
-Icreated a logo for the resturant I created like 5 of them
